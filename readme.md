# NBTItems

### What is NBTItems?

NBTItems is a plugin that adds configurable NBT items (admin items, quest items, etc.) to a minecraft server.

you should instead use the latest release provided.
Of course, if you're willing to take the risk, please expect it all to break.

The `main` branch contains the most stable code.

This entire plugin is very much a work in progress.
